Seeds of these obligate parasites require rhizospheric, host-released stimulants to germinate, which opens up possibilities for controlling them by applying specific germination inhibitors or synthetic stimulants that induce lethal germination in host's absence. To determine their effect on germination, root exudates or synthetic stimulants/inhibitors are usually applied to parasitic seeds in in vitro bioassays, followed by assessment of germination ratios. Although these protocols are very sensitive, the germination recording process is laborious, representing a challenge for researchers and impeding high-throughput screens. Here, we developed an automatic seed census tool to count and discriminate germinated from non-germinated seeds. We combined deep learning, a powerful data-driven framework that can accelerate the procedure and increase its accuracy, for object detection with computer vision latest development based on the Faster R-CNN algorithm. Our method showed an accuracy of 94% in counting seeds of Striga hermonthica and reduced the required time from ˜5 minutes to 5 seconds per image. Our proposed software, SeedQuant, will be of great help for seed germination bioassays and enable high-throughput screening for germination stimulants/inhibitors. SeedQuant is an open-source software that can be further trained to count different types of seeds for research purposes."

Their strong correlation makes it possible to predict the semantics of one from the other with good accuracy. Their intrinsic differences make cross-modal prediction a potentially more rewarding pretext task for self-supervised learning of video and audio representations compared to within-modality learning. Based on this intuition, we propose Cross-Modal Deep Clustering (XDC), a novel self-supervised method that leverages unsupervised clustering in one modality (e.g., audio) as a supervisory signal for the other modality (e.g., video). This cross-modal supervision helps XDC utilize the semantic correlation and the differences between the two modalities. Our experiments show that XDC outperforms single-modality clustering and other multi-modal variants. XDC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among self-supervised methods on multiple video and audio benchmarks. Most importantly, our video model pretrained on large-scale unlabeled data significantly outperforms the same model pretrained with full-supervision on ImageNet and Kinetics for action recognition on HMDB51 and UCF101. To the best of our knowledge, XDC is the first self-supervised learning method that outperforms large-scale fully-supervised pretraining for action recognition on the same architecture."

However, operating the engines at high load promotes abnormal combustion events, such as pre-ignition and potential superknock. Currently the most effective method for detecting pre-ignition is by using in-cylinder pressure sensors that have high precision and sensitivity, but also high cost. Due to rapid advances in automotive technology such as autonomous driving, computer-aided designs and future connectivity, we propose to use a complimentary data-driven strategy for diagnosing abnormal combustion events. To this end, a data-driven diagnostics approach for pre-ignition detection with deep neural networks is proposed. The success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in object detection and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in sequence forecasting inspired us to develop these models for pre-ignition detection. For a cost-effective strategy, we use data from less expensive sensors, such as lambda and low-resolution exhaust back pressure (EBP), instead of high resolution in-cylinder pressure measurements. The first deep learning model is combined with a commonly used dimensionality reduction tool–Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The second model eliminates this step and directly processes time-series data. Results indicate that the first model with reduced input dimensions, and correspondingly smaller size of the network, shows better performance in detecting pre-ignition cycles with an F1 score of 79%. Overall, the proposed deep learning approach is a promising alternative for abnormal combustion diagnostics using data from low resolution sensors."

Current works mostly seek to compress the network by reducing its parameters or parameter-incurred computation, neglecting the influence of the input image on the system complexity. Based on the fact that input images of a CNN contain substantial redundancy, in this paper, we propose a unified framework, dubbed as ThumbNet, to simultaneously accelerate and compress CNN models by enabling them to infer on one thumbnail image. We provide three effective strategies to train ThumbNet. In doing so, ThumbNet learns an inference network that performs equally well on small images as the original-input network on large images. With ThumbNet, not only do we obtain the thumbnail-input inference network that can drastically reduce computation and memory requirements, but also we obtain an image downscaler that can generate thumbnail images for generic classification tasks. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of ThumbNet, and demonstrate that the thumbnail-input inference network learned by ThumbNet can adequately retain the accuracy of the original-input network even when the input images are downscaled 16 times."

We then exploit the closed form expression of Gabor filters to derive an expression for a Lipschitz constant of such filters, and harness this theoretical result to develop a regularizer we use during training to further enhance network robustness. We conduct extensive experiments with various architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG16 and WideResNet) on several datasets (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and demonstrate large empirical robustness gains. Furthermore, we experimentally show how our regularizer provides consistent robustness improvements."

We propose a theoretically grounded analysis for DNNs robustness in the semantic space. We qualitatively analyze different DNNs semantic robustness by visualizing the DNN global behavior as semantic maps and observe interesting behavior of some DNNs. Since generating these semantic maps does not scale well with the dimensionality of the semantic space, we develop a bottom-up approach to detect robust regions of DNNs. To achieve this, We formalize the problem of finding robust semantic regions of the network as optimization of integral bounds and develop expressions for update directions of the region bounds. We use our developed formulations to quantitatively evaluate the semantic robustness of different famous network architectures. We show through extensive experimentation that several networks, though trained on the same dataset and while enjoying comparable accuracy, they do not necessarily perform similarly in semantic robustness. For example, InceptionV3 is more accurate despite being less semantically robust than ResNet50. We hope that this tool will serve as the first milestone towards understanding the semantic robustness of DNNs."

This phenomenon has been extensively studied in the image domain, and has only recently been extended to 3D point clouds. In this work, we present novel data-driven adversarial attacks against 3D point cloud networks. We aim to address the following problems in current 3D point cloud adversarial attacks: they do not transfer well between different networks, and they are easy to defend against via simple statistical methods. To this extent, we develop a new point cloud attack (dubbed AdvPC) that exploits the input data distribution by adding an adversarial loss, after Auto-Encoder reconstruction, to the objective it optimizes. AdvPC leads to perturbations that are resilient against current defenses, while remaining highly transferable compared to state-of-the-art attacks. We test AdvPC using four popular point cloud networks: PointNet, PointNet++ (MSG and SSG), and DGCNN. Our proposed attack increases the attack success rate by up to 40% for those transferred to unseen networks (transferability), while maintaining a high success rate on the attacked network. AdvPC also increases the ability to break defenses by up to 38% as compared to other baselines on the ModelNet40 dataset."

This has motivated much recent work on adversarial attacks for DNNs, which mostly focus on pixel-level perturbations void of semantic meaning. In contrast, we present a general framework for adversarial attacks on trained agents, which covers semantic perturbations to the environment of the agent performing the task as well as pixel-level attacks. To do this, we re-frame the adversarial attack problem as learning a distribution of parameters that always fools the agent. In the semantic case, our proposed adversary (denoted as BBGAN) is trained to sample parameters that describe the environment with which the black-box agent interacts, such that the agent performs its dedicated task poorly in this environment. We apply BBGAN on three different tasks, primarily targeting aspects of autonomous navigation: object detection, self-driving, and autonomous UAV racing. On these tasks, BBGAN can generate failure cases that consistently fool a trained agent."

In this paper, we push the boundaries of super-resolving (hallucinating to be more accurate) a tiny, non-frontal face image to understand how much of this is possible by leveraging the availability of large datasets and deep networks. To this end, we introduce a novel Transformative Adversarial Neural Network (TANN) to jointly frontalize very-low resolution (i.e. $16\\times 16$ pixels) out-of-plane rotated face images (including profile views) and aggressively super-resolve them ($8\\times$), regardless of their original poses and without using any 3D information. TANN is composed of two components: a transformative upsampling network which embodies encoding, spatial transformation and deconvolutional layers, and a discriminative network that enforces the generated high-resolution frontal faces to lie on the same manifold as real frontal face images. We evaluate our method on a large set of synthesized non-frontal face images to assess its reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TANN generates both qualitatively and quantitatively superior results achieving over 4 dB improvement over the state-of-the-art."

One approach to overcome the drawbacks of an end-to-end policy is to train a network only on the perception task and handle control with a PID or MPC controller.

The result is a network that is able to learn a good fusion of filtered trajectories from different controllers leading to significant improvements in overall performance.

Rather than defining semantic parts manually, we detect key points of each pedestrian proposal and then extract six semantic parts according to the predicted key points, e.g., head, upper-body, left/right arms and legs. Then, we crop and resize the semantic parts and pad them with the original proposal images. The padded images containing semantic part information are passed through CNN for further classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of adding semantic part information, which achieves superior performance on the Caltech benchmark dataset.'

However, FSOD performance is highly affected by the quality of annotations available in training. Furthermore, FSOD approaches require tremendous instance-level annotations, which are time-consuming to collect. In contrast, weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) exploits easily-collected image-level labels while it suffers from relatively inferior detection performance. In this paper, we study the effect of missing annotations on FSOD methods and analyze approaches to train an object detector from a hybrid dataset, where both instancelevel and image-level labels are employed. Extensive experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 benchmarks strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which gives a trade-off between collecting fewer annotations and building a more accurate object detector. Our method is also a strong baseline bridging the wide gap between FSOD and WSOD performances.'

In VQA, adversarial attacks can target the image and/or the proposed main question and yet there is a lack of proper analysis of the later. In this work, we propose a flexible framework that focuses on the language part of VQA that uses semantically relevant questions, dubbed basic questions, acting as controllable noise to evaluate the robustness of VQA models. We hypothesize that the level of noise is positively correlated to the similarity of a basic question to the main question. Hence, to apply noise on any given main question, we rank a pool of basic questions based on their similarity by casting this ranking task as a LASSO optimization problem. Then, we propose a novel robustness measure Rscore and two large-scale basic question datasets (BQDs) in order to standardize robustness analysis for VQA models.'

The literature abounds with many seminal works that address this problem, some focusing on continuous approaches (e.g., linear program relaxation), while others on discrete ones (e.g., min-cut). However, since many of these methods are designed to solve specific IP forms, they cannot adequately satisfy the simultaneous requirements of accuracy, feasibility, and scalability. To this end, we propose a novel and versatile framework called lp-box ADMM, which is based on two main ideas. (1) The discrete constraint is equivalently replaced by the intersection of a box and an lp-norm sphere. (2) We infuse this equivalence into the ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) framework to handle the continuous constraints separately and to harness its attractive properties. More importantly, the ADMM update steps can lead to manageable sub-problems in the continuous domain. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply it to an optimization form that occurs often in computer vision and machine learning, namely binary quadratic programming (BQP). In this case, the ADMM steps are simple, computationally efficient. Moreover, we present the theoretic analysis about the global convergence of the lp-box ADMM through adding a perturbation with the sufficiently small factor ϵ to the original IP problem. Specifically, the globally converged solution generated by lp-box ADMM for the perturbed IP problem will be close to the stationary and feasible point of the original IP problem within O(ϵ). We demonstrate the applicability of lp-box ADMM on three important applications: MRF energy minimization, graph matching, and clustering. Results clearly show that it significantly outperforms existing generic IP solvers both in runtime and objective. It also achieves very competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods designed specifically for these applications.'

The key point to handle missing labels is propagating the label information from the provided labels to missing labels, through a dependency graph that each label of each instance is treated as a node. We build this graph by utilizing different types of label dependencies. Specifically, the instance-level similarity is served as undirected edges to connect the label nodes across different instances and the semantic label hierarchy is used as directed edges to connect different classes. This base graph is referred to as the mixed dependency graph, as it includes both undirected and directed edges. Furthermore, we present another two types of label dependencies to connect the label nodes across different classes. One is the class co-occurrence, which is also encoded as undirected edges. Combining with the above base graph, we obtain a new mixed graph, called mixed graph with co-occurrence (MG-CO). The other is the sparse and low rank decomposition of the whole label matrix, to embed high-order dependencies over all labels. Combining with the base graph, the new mixed graph is called as MG-SL (mixed graph with sparse and low rank decomposition). Based on MG-CO and MG-SL, we further propose two convex transductive formulations of the MLML problem, denoted as MLMG-CO and MLMG-SL respectively. In both formulations, the instance-level similarity is embedded through a quadratic smoothness term, while the semantic label hierarchy is used as a linear constraint. In MLMG-CO, the class co-occurrence is also formulated as a quadratic smoothness term, while the sparse and low rank decomposition is incorporated into MLMG-SL, through two additional matrices (one is assumed as sparse, and the other is assumed as low rank) and an equivalence constraint between the summation of this two matrices and the original label matrix. Interestingly, two important applications, including image annotation and tag based image retrieval, can be jointly handled using our proposed methods. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our methods lead to significant improvements in performance and robustness to missing labels over the state-of-the-art methods.'

Such approaches incline to find the most representative parts of objects, and only seek one ground-truth box per class even though many same-class instances exist. To overcome these issues, we propose a weakly-supervised to fully-supervised framework, where a weakly-supervised detector is implemented using multiple instance learning.

However, most of these methods do not account for facial structure and suffer from degradations due to large pose variations and misalignments. In this paper, we propose a method that explicitly incorporates structural information of faces into the face super-resolution process by using a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN). Our CNN has two branches: one for super-resolving face images and the other branch for predicting salient regions of a face coined facial component heatmaps. These heatmaps encourage the upsampling stream to generate super-resolved faces with higher-quality details. Our method not only uses low-level information (i.e., intensity similarity), but also middle-level information (i.e., face structure) to further explore spatial constraints of facial components from LR inputs images. Therefore, we are able to super-resolve very small unaligned face images (16×16 pixels) with a large upscaling factor of 8×, while preserving face structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network achieves superior face hallucination results and outperforms the state-of-the-art.'

To deal with small object detection problem, we propose an end-to-end multi-task generative adversarial network (MTGAN). In the MTGAN, the generator is a super-resolution network, which can up-sample small blurred images into fine-scale ones and recover detailed information for more accurate detection. The discriminator is a multitask network, which describes each super-resolution image patch with a real/fake score, object category scores, and bounding box regression offsets. Furthermore, to make the generator recover more details for easier detection, the classification and regression losses in the discriminator are back-propagated into the generator during training. Extensive experiments on the challenging COCO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in restoring a clear super-resolution image from a blurred small one, and show that the detection performance, especially for small sized objects, improves over state-of-the-art methods.'

Although significant progress has also been made, there is still a large gap on the performance between weakly-supervised and fully-supervised object detection. To mitigate this gap, some works try to use the pseudo ground truths generated by a weakly-supervised detector to train a supervised detector. However, such approaches incline to find the most representative parts instead of the whole body of an object, and only seek one ground truth bounding-box per class even though many same-class instances exist in an image. To address these issues, we propose a weakly-supervised to fully-supervised framework (W2F), where a weakly-supervised detector is implemented using multiple instance learning. And then, we propose a pseudo ground-truth excavation (PGE) algorithm to find the accurate pseudo ground truth bounding-box for each instance. Moreover, the pseudo ground-truth adaptation (PGA) algorithm is designed to further refine those pseudo ground truths mined by PGE algorithm. Finally, the mined pseudo ground truths are used as supervision to train a fully-supervised detector. Additionally, we also propose an iterative ground-truth learning (IGL) approach, which enhances the quality of the pseudo ground truths by using the predictions of the fully-supervised detector iteratively. Extensive experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 benchmarks strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We obtain 53.1% and 49.4% mAP on VOC2007 and VOC2012 respectively, which is a significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods.'

We present an approach to transferring driving policies from simulation to reality via modularity and abstraction. Our approach is inspired by classic driving systems and aims to combine the benefits of modular architectures and end-to-end deep learning approaches. The key idea is to encapsulate the driving policy such that it is not directly exposed to raw perceptual input or low-level vehicle dynamics. We evaluate the presented approach in simulated urban environments and in the real world. In particular, we transfer a driving policy trained in simulation to a 1/5-scale robotic truck that is deployed in a variety of conditions, with no finetuning, on two continents.

Removing this noise is an important task in image restoration. State-of-the-art methods such as Adaptive Outlier Pursuit(AOP) [57], which is based on TV with l02-norm data fidelity, only give sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a new sparse optimization method, called l0TV-PADMM, which solves the TV-based restoration problem with l0-norm data fidelity. To effectively deal with the resulting non-convex non-smooth optimization problem, we first reformulate it as an equivalent biconvex Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC), and then solve it using a proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (PADMM). Our l0TV-PADMM method finds a desirable solution to the original l0-norm optimization problem and is proven to be convergent under mild conditions. We apply l0TV-PADMM to the problems of image denoising and deblurring in the presence of impulse noise.

In the vision community, it found its way into many important applications, including face recognition, tracking, super resolution, image denoising, to name a few. Despite advances in efficient sparse algorithms, solving large-scale LASSO problems remains a challenge. To circumvent this difficulty, people tend to downsample and subsample the problem (e.g. via dimensionality reduction) to maintain a manageable sized LASSO, which usually comes at the cost of losing solution accuracy. This paper proposes a novel circulant reformulation of the LASSO that lifts the problem to a higher dimension, where ADMM can be efficiently applied to its dual form. Because of this lifting, all optimization variables are updated using only basic element-wise operations, the most computationally expensive of which is a 1D FFT. In this way, there is no need for a linear system solver nor matrix-vector multiplication. Since all operations in our FFTLasso method are element-wise, the subproblems are completely independent and can be trivially parallelized (e.g. on a GPU). The attractive computational properties of FFTLasso are verified by extensive experiments on synthetic and real data and on the face recognition task. They demonstrate that FFTLasso scales much more effectively than a state-of-the-art solver.'

Its goal is to describe an image using a limited number of tags, whereby the retrieved tags need to cover as much useful information about the image as possible. As compared to the conventional image annotation task, DIA requires the tags to be not only representative of the image but also diverse from each other, so as to reduce redundancy. To this end, we treat DIA as a subset selection problem, based on the conditional determinantal point process (DPP) model, which encodes representation and diversity jointly. We further explore semantic hierarchy and synonyms among candidate tags to define weighted semantic paths. It is encouraged that two tags with the same semantic path are not retrieved simultaneously for the same image. This restriction is embedded into the algorithm used to sample from the learned conditional DPP model. Interestingly, we find that conventional metrics for image annotation (e.g., precision, recall, and F 1 score) only consider an overall representative capacity of all the retrieved tags, while ignoring their diversity. Thus, we propose new semantic metrics based on our proposed weighted semantic paths. An extensive subject study verifies that the proposed metrics are much more consistent with human evaluation than conventional annotation metrics. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed method produces more representative and diverse tags, compared with existing methods.'

However, learning multidimensional dictionaries and sparse codes for the reconstruction of multi-dimensional data is very important, as it examines correlations among all the data jointly. This provides more capacity for the learned dictionaries to better reconstruct data. In this paper, we propose a generic and novel formulation for the CSC problem that can handle an arbitrary order tensor of data. Backed with experimental results, our proposed formulation can not only tackle applications that are not possible with standard CSC solvers, including colored video reconstruction (5D--tensors), but it also performs favorably in reconstruction with much fewer parameters as compared to naive extensions of standard CSC to multiple features/channels.'

We then use the 3D information to orient, place, and score bounding boxes around objects. We independently estimate the orientation for every object, using previous techniques that utilize normal information. Object locations and sizes in 3D are learned using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). In the final step, we refine our detections based on object class relations within a scene. When compared to state-of-the-art detection methods that operate almost entirely in the sparse 3D domain, extensive experiments on the well-known SUN RGBD dataset [29] show that our proposed method is muchfaster (4.1s per image) in detecting 3D objects in RGB-D images and performs better (3 mAP higher) than the state-of-the-art method that is 4.7 times slower and comparably to the method that is two orders of magnitude slower.

Because of the circulant structure property, CST has the following advantages: (1) It can refine and reduce particles using circular shifts of target templates. (2) The optimization can be efficiently solved entirely in the Fourier domain. (3) High dimensional features can be embedded into CST to significantly improve tracking performance without sacrificing much computation time. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on challenging benchmark sequences demonstrate that CST performs better than all other sparse trackers and favorably against state-of-the-art methods.'

These circularly shifted patches are only approximations to actual translations in the image, which become unreliable in many realistic tracking scenarios including fast motion, occlusion, etc. In these cases, the traditional use of a single centered Gaussian as the target response impedes tracker performance and can lead to unrecoverable drift. To circumvent this major drawback, we propose a generic framework that can adaptively change the target response from frame to frame, so that the tracker is less sensitive to the cases where circular shifts do not reliably approximate translations. To do that, we reformulate the underlying optimization to solve for both the filter and target response jointly, where the latter is regularized by measurements made using actual translations. This joint problem has a closed form solution and thus allows for multiple templates, kernels, and multi-dimensional features. Extensive experiments on the popular OTB100 benchmark [19] show that our target adaptive framework can be combined with many CF trackers to realize significant overall performance improvement (ranging from 3%-13.5% in precision and 3.2%-13% in accuracy), especially in categories where this adaptation is necessary (e.g. fast motion, motion blur, etc.).'

Most existing works on AU recognition assumed that the complete label assignment for each training image is available, which is often not the case in practice. Labeling AU is expensive and time consuming process. Moreover, due to the AU ambiguity and subjective difference, some AUs are difficult to label reliably and confidently. Many AU recognition works try to train the classifier for each AU independently, which is of high computation cost and ignores the dependency among different AUs. In this work, we formulate AU recognition under incomplete data as a multi-label learning with missing labels (MLML) problem. Most existing MLML methods usually employ the same features for all classes. However, we find this setting is unreasonable in AU recognition, as the occurrence of different AUs produce changes of skin surface displacement or face appearance in different face regions. If using the shared features for all AUs, much noise will be involved due to the occurrence of other AUs. Consequently, the changes of the specific AUs cannot be clearly highlighted, leading to the performance degradation. Instead, we propose to extract the most discriminative features for each AU individually, which are learned by the supervised learning method. The learned features are further embedded into the instance-level label smoothness term of our model, which also includes the label consistency and the class-level label smoothness. Both a global solution using st-cut and an approximated solution using conjugate gradient (CG) descent are provided. Experiments on both posed and spontaneous facial expression databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison with several state-of-the-art works.'

Our benchmark aims at covering a wide range of complex human activities that are of interest to people in their daily living. In its current version, ActivityNet provides samples from 203 activity classes with an average of 137 untrimmed videos per class and 1.41 activity instances per video, for a total of 849 video hours. We illustrate three scenarios in which ActivityNet can be used to compare algorithms for human activity understanding: untrimmed video classification, trimmed activity classification and activity detection.'

This paper focuses on TV for image restoration in the presence of impulse noise. This type of noise frequently arises in data acquisition and transmission due to many reasons, e.g. a faulty sensor or analog-to-digital converter errors. Removing this noise is an important task in image restoration. State-of-the-art methods such as Adaptive Outlier Pursuit(AOP), which is based on TV with L02-norm data fidelity, only give sub-optimal performance.In this paper, we propose a new method, called L0T V -PADMM, which solves the TV-based restoration problem with L0-norm data fidelity. To effectively deal with the resulting non-convex nonsmooth optimization problem, we first reformulate it as an equivalent MPEC (Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints), and then solve it using a proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (PADMM). Our L0TV-PADMM method finds a desirable solution to the original L0-norm optimization problem and is proven to be convergent under mild conditions. We apply L0TV-PADMM to the problems of image denoising and deblurring in the presence of impulse noise. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that L0TV-PADMM outperforms state-of-the-art image restoration methods.'

In this paper, we propose a novel Structural Sparse Tracking (SST) algorithm, which not only exploits the intrinsic relationship among target candidates and their local patches to learn their sparse representations jointly, but also preserves the spatial layout structure among the local patches inside each target candidate. We show that our SST algorithm accommodates most existing sparse trackers with the respective merits.

In a variational framework, we formulate the problem as a minimization of an energy composed of two terms: a data term and a regularity term. The first term is related to the image formation process and expresses the relation between the albedo, the surface normals, and the incident illumination. We use an affine shading model, a combination of a Lambertian model, and an ambient lighting term. This model is relevant for Lambertian surfaces. When available, multiple views can be used to handle view-dependent non- Lambertian reflections. The second term contains an efficient combination of l2 and l1-regularizers on the illumination vector field and albedo respectively. Unlike most previous approaches, especially Retinex-like techniques, these terms do not depend on the image gradient or texture, thus reducing the mixing shading/reflectance artifacts and leading to better results.

We analyze various visual factors that may influence object memorability (e.g. color, visual saliency, and object categories).

Since we model particles as linear combinations of dictionary templates that are updated dynamically, learning the representation of each particle is considered a single task in Multi-Task Tracking (MTT). By employing popularsparsity-inducinglp,q mixednorms(specificallyp ∈ {2, ∞} and q = 1), we regularize the representation problem to enforce joint sparsity and learn the particle representations together. As compared to previous methods that handle particles independently, our results demonstrate that mining the interdependencies between particles improves tracking performance and overall computational complexity. Interestingly, we show that the popular L1 tracker (Mei and Ling, IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intel 33(11):2259–2272, 2011) is a special case of our MTT formulation (denoted as the L11 tracker) when p = q = 1. Under the MTT framework, some of the tasks (particle representations) are often more closely related and more likely to share common relevant covariates than other tasks. Therefore, we extend the MTT framework to take into account pairwise structural correlations between particles (e.g. spatial smooth- ness of representation) and denote the novel framework as S-MTT. The problem of learning the regularized sparse representation in MTT and S-MTT can be solved efficiently using an Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) method that yields a sequence of closed form updates. As such, S-MTT and MTT are computationally attractive. We test our pro- posed approach on challenging sequences involving heavy occlusion, drastic illumination changes, and large pose variations. Experimental results show that S-MTT is much better than MTT, and both methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art trackers.'

Most existing software packages for sports video analysis require manual annotation of important events in the video. American football is the most popular sport in the United States, however most game analysis is still done manually. Line of scrimmage and offensive team formation recognition are two statistics that must be tagged by American Football coaches when watching and evaluating past play video clips, a process which takes many man hours per week. These two statistics are also the building blocks for more high-level analysis such as play strategy inference and automatic statistic generation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework where given an American football play clip, we automatically identify the video frame in which the offensive team lines in formation (formation frame), the line of scrimmage for that play, and the type of player formation the offensive team takes on. The proposed framework achieves 95% accuracy in detecting the formation frame, 98% accuracy in detecting the line of scrimmage, and up to 67% accuracy in classifying the offensive team's formation. To validate our framework, we compiled a large dataset comprising more than 800 play-clips of standard and high definition resolution from real-world football games.

They assume the errors caused by image variations can be modeled as pixel-wise sparse. However, in many practical scenarios these errors are not truly pixel-wise sparse but rather sparsely distributed in a structured way. In fact, pixels in error constitute contiguous regions within the object's track. This is the case when significant occlusion occurs. To accommodate for non-sparse occlusion in a given frame, we assume that occlusion detected in previous frames can be propagated to the current one. This propagated information determines which pixels will contribute to the sparse representation of the current track. In other words, pixels that were detected as part of an occlusion in the previous frame will be removed from the target representation process. As such, this paper proposes a novel tracking algorithm that models and detects occlusion through structured sparse learning. We test our tracker on challenging benchmark sequences, such as sports videos, which involve heavy occlusion, drastic illumination changes, and large pose variations.

To enable the applica- tion of these tasks on a large-scale, scalability and computational efficiency are considered desirable properties for a practical semidefinite programming algorithm. In this paper, we theoretically analyse a new bilateral greedy opti- mization(denoted BILGO) strategy in solving general semidefinite programs on large-scale datasets. As compared to existing methods, BILGO employs a bilateral search strategy during each optimization iteration. In such an iteration, the current semidefinite matrix solution is updated as a bilater- al linear combination of the previous solution and a suitable rank-1 matrix, which can be efficiently computed from the leading eigenvector of the descent direction at this iteration. By optimizing for the coefficients of the bilateral combination, BILGO reduces the cost function in every iteration until the KKT conditions are fully satisfied, thus, it tends to converge to a global opti- mum. For an ǫ-accurate solution, we prove the number of BILGO iterations needed for convergence is O(ǫ−1). The algorithm thus successfully combines the efficiency of conventional rank-1 update algorithms and the effectiveness of gradient descent. Moreover, BILGO can be easily extended to handle low rank constraints. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of BILGO, we apply it to two important machine learning tasks, namely Mahalanobis metric learning and maximum variance unfolding. Extensive experimental results clearly demonstrate that BILGO can solve large-scale semidefinite programs efficiently.'

The optimal combination of these cues is learned in a data-driven fashion using user preferences (expert input) as ground truth.

Examples of DS abound in nature, e.g., herds of animals and flocks of birds. To capture the local spatiotemporal properties of the DS, we present a probabilistic model that learns both the spatial layout of swarm elements (based on low-level image segmentation) and their joint dynamics that are modeled as linear transformations. To this end, a spatiotemporal neighborhood is associated with each swarm element, in which local stationarity is enforced both spatially and temporally. We assume that the prior on the swarm dynamics is distributed according to an MRF in both space and time. Embedding this model in a MAP framework, we iterate between learning the spatial layout of the swarm and its dynamics. We learn the swarm transformations using ICM, which iterates between estimating these transformations and updating their distribution in the spatiotemporal neighborhoods.

We frame the registration problem in a sparse representation setting, where outlier pixels are assumed to be sparse in an image. Here, robust video registration (RVR) becomes equivalent to solving a sequence of `1 minimization problems, each of which can be solved using the Inexact Augmented Lagrangian Method (IALM). Our RVR method is made efficient (sublinear complexity in the number of pixels) by exploiting a hybrid coarse-to-fine and random sampling strategy along with the temporal smoothness of camera motion. We showcase RVR in the domain of sports videos, specifically American football.

To address the problem of multi-object tracking in sports videos, we go beyond the video frame domain and make use of information in a homography transform domain that is denoted the homography field domain. We propose a novel particle filter based tracking algorithm that uses both object appearance information (e.g. color and shape) in the image domain and cross-domain contextual information in the field domain to improve object tracking. In the field domain, the effect of fast camera motion is significantly alleviated since the underlying homography transform from each frame to the field domain can be accurately estimated. We use contextual trajectory information (intra-trajectory and inter-trajectory context) to further improve the prediction of object states within an particle filter framework. Here, intra-trajectory contextual information is based on history tracking results in the field domain, while inter-trajectory contextual information is extracted from a compiled trajectory dataset based on tracks computed from videos depicting the same sport.
